**Discord Rules:**
_-Be Respectful, Keep General Chat Civil. If something becomes personal, take it to DM's._
_-No Spamming, racism, harassment in any channel._
_-Personal abuse, obscene, harassing, threatening, hateful, discriminatory or defamatory remarks of any nature won't be tolerated. This includes racial, sexual, homophobic or cultural slurs, even in the context of a joke/meme._
_-#looking-for-a-squad is where you inquire for a team. Leave it out of general chat._
_-Don't talk about DDoS, hacking or glitching outside of a report ticket._
_-Do not mass tag (@ roles, everyone, donator, here, etc.)_
_-No discussing any topics that could break Discord TOS._
_-Deliberately creating toxic situations or debates in order to undermine other players or the staff is not acceptable._
_-Refrain from using multiple lines to convey a single thought or idea._
_-No creating False Tickets._
_-Nicknames containing invisible, unreadable, or unmentionable characters that make chat interaction nearly impossible are not allowed._
**Most of these rules are common sense so if a moderator or administrator suspects that you're knowingly breaking the rules, you may be punished without warning.**
